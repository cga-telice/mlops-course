    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",

    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
