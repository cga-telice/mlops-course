## <h1 align="center" id="heading">Evaluating Advanced Retrieval Methods in LangChain with Ragas!</h1>

In today's assignment, we'll be evaluating advanced retrieval methods with RAGAS.

The Colab version of the Assignment can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KhblGn9jnl2pwjbHUkfFcpdn2PJWqBNl?usp=sharing).

## Build 🏗️

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  1. Install required libraries
  2. Set Environment Variables
  3. Creating a simple RAG pipeline with [LangChain v0.1.0](https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-v0-1-0/)
  

- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  1. Synthetic Dataset Generation for Evaluation using the [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
  2. Evaluating our pipeline with Ragas
  3. Making Adjustments to our RAG Pipeline
  4. Evaluating our Adjusted pipeline against our baseline
  5. Testing OpenAI's Claim
