Close the gap on health and workplace safety with \\ncontractors/ sub-contractors by using tools to share information on the hazards of chemicals on the \\nworksite. Identify occupational health and safety hazards is the first step to being proactive in \\nprevention in the field of construction.

Activities like change of job on daily basis, simultaneous operations and movement of workers \\non a jobsite require chemical management systems to minimize the risk. There are two primary \\nproblems when it comes to addressing and protecting construction employees for personal injuries \\nsustained from chemical exposure. The first issue is that many workers do not realize they were \\nexposed to any chemical at all, until a health condition related to toxic exposure presents itself.',\n",
       "  'Employees may not be able to recall when they were exposed, at what location, or under what \\ncircumstances they came into contact with a hazardous chemical. \\nUnlike other common types of injury on the construction site, including falls or abrasions that are \\ntreated with emergency care (and documented by employer at job site/ a clinic or hospital), the \\nworker may leave the job site and never know that they have been exposed to a potentially life-\\nthreatening chemical. One that could contribute to serious chronic diseases, organ failure or \\ncancer over time. This is why safe work procedure and regulatory provisions are critical to \\nprotecting workers from chemical exposure.'],\n",
